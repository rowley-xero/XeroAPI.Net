XeroApi .Net Library 
====================

![Project status](http://stillmaintained.com/XeroAPI/XeroAPI.Net.png)


Introduction
------------

This is a .Net wrapper library, written in C#, used to comnunicate with the Xero Core API (http://api.xero.com).  There is a branch that adds support for the [Payroll API](https://github.com/XeroAPI/XeroAPI.Net/tree/payroll) [(payroll API documentation)](http://developer.xero.com/documentation/payroll-api/overview/)

You can use this library to communicate with the Xero API, without needing any prior knowledge of Xml or OAuth. The library can work in [public](http://developer.xero.com/api-overview/setup-an-application/#public-apps), [private](http://developer.xero.com/api-overview/setup-an-application/#private-apps) or [partner](http://developer.xero.com/api-overview/setup-an-application/#partner-apps) mode.

Note: Unless you're looking to debug the library, you don't need to download the source code and compile it yourself. Each release is published to the NuGet package repository (http://nuget.org/List/Packages/XeroAPI.Net).

If you have any questions or problems using this library, have a look at the Xero API Answers site (https://community.xero.com/developer/).


Features
--------

This library contains a linq provider for writing linq queries:

	var bankAccounts = from account in repository.Accounts
					   where account.Type == "BANK"
					   select account;

Or, using linq extension methods...

	int invoiceCount = repository.Contacts
		.Where(c => c.UpdatedDateUTC >= DateTime.UtcNow.AddMonths(-1))
		.Count();

Entities can be created or updated using the familiar repository pattern:

	Contact contact = new Contact
	{
		Name = "Joe Bloggs",
		FirstName = "Joe",
		LastName = "Bloggs",
		EmailAddress = "joe.bloggs@nowhere.com"
	};
	
	repository.Create(contact);

Installation
------------
There are 2 ways to install this library:

1. Download the source code from github and compile yourself:
 **https://github.com/XeroAPI/XeroAPI.Net**

2. Download directly into Visual Studio using the NuGet powershell command:
 **PM&gt; Install-Package XeroAPI.Net**


Usage
-----

There are sample projects in the git repository show how to use the library:

1. **XeroApi.Console** - A console app that can run in public, private or partner mode.
2. **XeroApi.MvcWebApp** - An ASP.Net MVC2 web app that runs in partner mode.

In fact, here's one I wrote earlier:

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            IOAuthSession session = new XeroApi.OAuth.XeroApiPrivateSession(
                "XeroAPI Mini App",
                "YOUR-CONSUMER-KEY",
                new X509Certificate2(@"D:\Your-Certificate.pfx", "your-pfx-password"));

            Repository repository = new Repository(session);
            
            Console.WriteLine("You're connected to " + repository.Organisation.Name);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }

.
